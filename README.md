Finally, as part of my javascript learning process, I am creating this form validation here.
Similar to a Facebook form validation, this form validation is not your typical one. When I first sign up on Facebook.com, I notice that the form is very different from other forms found on websites. It is used to gather more specific user data according to our needs, and it prevents any user from entering data on its own.

This sign-up form's features include:
!------- Features -------!
First name, last name, email address, and password are among the four input fields on this form. Data must be entered into each of the four fields.
The previous input field notifications appear if the user clicks on any input field, moves the cursor out of that field, and clicks on another input field. additionally, every form input element is subject to this constraint.
When a user clicks the signup button without enter data on all input field, the input field messages appear.Here, I'm using regular expression exclusively for strong passwords in password validation. A strong password is one that is created when a user enters a mixture of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special symbols; otherwise, the password becomes weak. In the present world, weak passwords are easily stolen and strong passwords are almost never stolen.
A strong password is required for many production-ready web applications these days, as technology is advanced and there are plenty of hackers available online who can simply steal weak passwords.
These functions are the only ones that Olny has included thus far. Based on my experience, I will need to add some more features later.
